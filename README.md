eBird Automation

Various tools and utilities I've written to help me with eBird.


# Location naming
I create a lot of personal locations, I'm think the fidelity of personal locations is more scientificly relevent that a generalised hotspot.  Don't get me wrong, if I'm at a location where there is an obvious hotspot I use it.  But Australia is big, so I avoid using hotspots if they are too general or if the are not really close to where I am birding.  However, I have a problem.  I like neat things.  The default name eBird gives a location is messy and doesn't sort well and is long to read in the app.

So, to make things neat, and more practile to find my own locations in the mobile app (I reuse them if I'm without 100m of an exisitng one) I have a naming scheme I use.  It is simple.  The geographic area plus the GPS coordinates.  So something like this `Baldivis ( -32.276319, 115.840975 )`

I don't try to do this in the field.  I can't even if I wanted to as often a companion is creating the list.  So instead, I use to come home and fix all the location names.   It was tedious but a bit of meditation and wouldn't take long for a day trip but could take ages for a week long trip, especially when a few of the guys I bird with are like me and log everything and also like the fidelity of personal locations.   I'd watch YouTube and work through them.  Not hard, easy, but a little error prone and lots of clicking.   

I've solve this and wrote a macro in UI.Vision that will do this for me.  I now go to locations in MyEbird and work through the new locations created on a trip/day, open each one, run the macro.  Easy.

That macro is here as are some related scripts.   

This is very unique to me and my own quirks and I don't expect anyone elese to use it.  However, perhaps it might one day give someone some clues on how to us UI.Vsion with eBird if they have their own 'thing' they'd like to solve.

#  Bird data Apple Shortcut

I have a shortcut that with a `Hey Siri - Log bird data` will capture some dication (obviously I just say the name of the bird I can see or short sentance with some extra info) that will take that dication, turn it into text and save it to a log in Notes.  It appends date/time and GPS info to each dication.  I use it when driving to capture details about birds I want to record in eBird.  I've logged a $450 Wedge-tailed Eagle (a camera caught me touching my phone) so I don't try to log when driving any more.  I don't try to record every single bird I see when driving, but I do like to capture at least the raptors and occationaly other interesting birds.  This will help.  A bit of manual messing around when home, but it means I capture birds I'm interested in.

I hope to figure out how to share that shortcut here, even if a document so someone can take the idea and use it (not here yet).  Happy to share if you reach out to me.
